# Code-challenge-Wk-1-Toy-Problems
This is a repository that contains my first code challenge. And it's title is "Toy Problems".
These are the instructions of how to set up this git repository into your local machine.

# Instructions
## Fork and clone this repository into your local environment
## View and grade on your end while making any changes if need be


# CHALLENGE 1 : Student Grade Generator
# Description
The Students Grade Generator program prompts the user to input student marks. It goes on to evaluates these marks and assigns a corresponding grade based on predefined criteria:
A - Marks greater than 79
B - Marks between 60 and 79
C - Marks  between 50 and 59
D - Marks between 40 and 49
E - Marks less than 40

# Solution Overview and Working
This involves processing user input,evaluating the marks directly against the criteria and outputting the expected grade.
We use conditional statements to determine the grade, while considering the input mark.

# CHALLENGE 2 : Speed Detector
# Description
The Speed Detector program takes input in form of the  speed of a car and calculates fine points based on how much the car has exceeded the speed limit. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, then the program tells them that their license is suspended.

# Solution Overview and Working
THis involves processing the car's speed as the input, calculating the fine points while basing it on the given speed limit while simultaneously handling situations where the fine points exceed the limit for license suspension.

# CHALLENGE 3: Net Salary Calculator
# Description
The Net Salary Calculator program calculates the net salary based on inputs of basic salary and the given benefits. It goes on to generate the net salary,gross salary, NSSF Deductions, NHIF Deductions and payee.

# Solution Overview and Working
This involves processing various taxes and deductions from the total salary in order to derive the net salary. It uses pre defined tax from NSSF and NhIF, so all the deductions are live.
